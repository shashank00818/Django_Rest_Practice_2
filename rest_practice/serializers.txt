Serializers:
> The data that is made while running the queries in Djnago are "Complex Datatype of Python".
> The frontend cannot understand these Complex Datatypes.
> We need to convert Complex Datatype into "Native Datatype" and then send it to frontend in
 "JSON" or "XML" form.
> The process of converting Complex to Native datatype is called Serialization.
